The posting specifically mentions having knowledge of React, which is something I have not yet learned this semestr.

For this exploration I created a basic poll creation app in React. It lets you create a poll question with two options to pick from, the ability to vote for either of the options in the poll, and the ability to delete polls. The app is very basic but I learned a lot about React while making it.

I started off by following the tutorial on React's website that involved creating a tic-tac-toe game. Although the tutorial did a pretty good job of explaining React concepts, I wish it did a better job of showing how to create an actual website on React. I then watched a tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY) that gave me a much better idea of how I'd go about creating something with React. Given that the tutorial was a couple years old, I had some problems following along. First, I had some issues just creating a react app, but I found a solution for that [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/10601). Then along the way I had an issue importing the uuid library to create unique ids for list items, but found help at [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52852018/use-npm-uuid-in-reactjs) stack overflow link. 

All in all I had a mixed experience with React. I think I would appreciate it more if I hadn't learned Angular yet, but now that I'm more familar with Angular it just seems to have a weirder syntax. However, I do like how React appears to give you much more freedom in how you develop.
